- The Webpage Audio API is a way to play sound and audio on a page and also change other properties of where the sound may play, how loud it may play and even get the data of the audio waves.
- I've included a simple file that plays music when you click a button and a way to change the volume and panning of the sound. I've also included examples of where you might use this in the real world.
